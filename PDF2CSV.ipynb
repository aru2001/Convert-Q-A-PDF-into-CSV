       "'1. What is namespace in Python? \\n \\nAnswer: In Python, every name introduced has a place where resides and \\ncan be found. This space is known as a \\nnamespace. It is an address location where a variable name is mapped to \\nthe object placed. Whenever the variable is \\nsearched out, this address location will be searched, to get the \\ncorresponding object. \\n \\n2. How do you make 3D plots/visualizations using NumPy/SciPy? \\n \\nAnswer: Like 2D plotting, 3D graphics is beyond the scope of NumPy and \\nSciPy, but just as in the 2D case, packages exist \\nthat integrate with NumPy. Matplotlib provides basic 3D plotting in the \\nmplot3d subpackage, whereas Mayavi provides a wide \\nrange of high-quality 3D visualization features, utilizing the powerful \\nVTK engine. \\n \\n3. Differentiate between .py and .pyc files? \\n \\nAnswer: Both .py and .pyc files hold the byte code. “.pyc” is a compiled \\nversion of Python file. This file is automatically \\ngenerated by Python to improve performance. The .pyc file is having byte \\ncode which is platform independent and can be \\nexecuted on any operating system that supports .pyc format. \\n \\nNote: there is no difference in speed when the program is read from .pyc \\nor .py file; the only difference is the load time. \\n \\n4. What are Python\\'s dictionaries? \\n \\nAnswer: Python\\'s dictionaries are kind of hash table type. They work like \\nassociative arrays or hashes found in Perl and \\nconsist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python \\ntype but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the \\nother hand, can be any arbitrary Python object. \\n \\n5. How do | send mail from a Python script? \\n \\nAnswer: Use the standard library module smtplib. Here’s a very simple \\ninteractive mail sender that uses it. This method will \\nwork on any host that supports an SMTP listener. \\n \\nimport sys, smtplib \\n \\nfromaddr = raw_input(“From: “) \\n \\ntoaddrs = raw_input(\"To: “).split(,’) \\n \\nprint “Enter message, end with *D:” \\n \\nmsg =\" \\n \\nwhile 1: \\n \\nline = sys.stdin.readline() \\n \\nif not line: \\n\\n\\x0c \\nbreak \\n \\nmsg = msg + line \\n \\n# The actual mail sends \\n \\nserver = smtplib.SMTP(‘localhost’) \\nserver.sendmail(fromaddr, toaddrs, msg) \\n \\nserver.quit() \\n \\nA UNIX-only alternative uses to send mail. The location of the send mail \\nprogram varies between systems; sometimes it is \\n/usr/lib/sendmail, sometime /usr/sbin/sendmail. The send mail manual page \\nwill help you out. Here’s some sample code: \\nSENDMAIL = “/usr/sbin/sendmail” # sendmail location \\nimport os \\n \\np = os.popen(“%s -t -i” % SENDMAIL, “w”) \\n \\np.write(“To: receiver@example.comn\") \\np.write(“Subject: testn”) \\n \\np.write(“n’) # blank line separating headers from body \\np.write(“Some textn”) \\n \\np.write(“some more textn”) \\n \\nsts = p.close() \\n \\nif sts != 0: \\n \\nprint “Sendmail exit status”, sts \\n \\n6. Why is that none of my threads are not running? How can | make it \\nwork? \\n \\nAnswer: As soon as the main thread exits, all threads are killed. Your \\nmain thread is running too quickly, giving the threads no \\ntime to do any work. \\n \\nA simple fix is to add a sleep to the end of the program that’s long \\nenough for all the threads to finish: \\n \\nimport threading, time \\n \\ndef thread_task(name, n): \\n \\nfor | in range(n): print name, i \\n \\nfor | in range(10) \\n \\n7. Explain about ODBC and Python? \\n \\nAnswer: ODBC (“Open Database Connectivity) API standard allows the \\nconnections with any database that supports the \\n\\n\\x0cinterface, such as PostgreSQL database or Microsoft Access in a \\ntransparent manner. There are 3 ODBC modules for Python: \\nPythonWin ODBC module - limited development \\n \\nmxODBC - commercial product \\n \\npyodbe — it is an open source Python package. \\n \\n8. Explain Python\\'s pass by references Vs pass by value. (or) Explain \\nabout Python\\'s parameter passing mechanism? \\nAnswer: In Python, by default, all the parameters (arguments) are passed \\n“by reference” to the functions. Thus, if you change \\nthe value of the parameter within a function, the change is reflected in \\nthe calling function. We can even observe the pass “by \\nvalue” kind of behavior whenever we pass the arguments to functions that \\nare of type say numbers, strings, tuples. This is \\nbecause of the immutable nature of them. \\n \\n9. What is a module and package in Python? \\nAnswer: The module is the way to structure a program. Each Python program \\nfile is a module, which imports other modules \\n \\nlike objects and attributes. \\n \\nThe folder of the Python program is a package of modules. A package can \\nhave modules or subfolders. \\n \\n10. How does exception handling in Python differ from Java? \\n \\nAnswer: optional clauses for a block In Python. \\n \\nPython has its own method of implementing exception handling. is the \\nblock which can be used by the programmer to see \\nthe error details without having to terminate the program. Also, in some \\ncases, this statement offers a solution to deal with \\nthe error. \\n \\n11. Control flow statements? \\n \\nAnswer: By default, python program execution starts from the first line, \\nexecute each and every statement only once and \\ntransactions the program if the last statement of the program execution \\nis over. \\n \\nControl flow statements are used to disturb the normal flow of the \\nexecution of the program. \\n \\n12. What is a Tuple? \\n \\nAnswer: \\n \\n1. Tuple Objects can be created by using parenthesis or by calling tuple \\nfunction or by assigning multiple values to a single \\nvariable \\n \\n2. Tuple objects are immutable objects \\n \\n3. Incision order is preserved \\n\\n\\x0c \\n4. Duplicate elements are allowed \\n \\n5. Heterogeneous elements are allowed \\n \\n6. Tuple supports both positive and negative indexing \\n7. The elements of the tuple can be mutable or immutable \\nExample: \\n \\nx=() \\n \\nprint(x) \\n \\nprint(type(x)) \\n \\nprint(len(x)) \\n \\ny-tuple() \\n \\nprint(y) \\n \\nprint(type(y)) \\n \\nprint(len(y)) \\n \\nz=10,20 \\n \\nprint(z) \\n \\nprint(type(z)) \\n \\nprint(len(z)) \\n \\np=(10,20,30,40,50,10,20,10) Insertion & duplicate \\nprint(p) \\n \\nq=(100, 123.123, True, “mindmajix”) Heterogeneous \\nprint(q). \\n \\n13. How can you Get the Google cache age of any URL or web page? \\nAnswer: \\n \\nUse the following URL format: \\n \\nBe sure to replace “URLGOESHERE” with the proper web address of the page \\nor site whose cache you want to retrieve and \\n \\nsee the time for. \\n \\n14, What is map function in Python? \\nAnswer: map function executes the function given as the first argument on \\nall the elements of the iterable given as the \\nsecond argument. If the function given takes in more than 1 arguments, \\nthen many iterables are given. \\n \\n15. What is Anonymous Function or Lambda Function? \\n \\nAnswer: \\n\\n\\x0c \\nA function which doesn’t contain any name is known as an anonymous \\nfunction lambda function \\nSyntax: \\n \\nlambda arguments: expression \\n \\nLambda function we can assign to the variable & we can call the lambda \\nfunction through the variable \\n \\nExample: \\n \\nmyfunction=lambda x:x*x \\na=myfunction(10) \\nprint(a) \\n \\nOutput: 100 \\n \\n16. Modules Search Path?? \\n \\nAnswer: By default python interpreter search for the imported modules in \\nthe following locations: \\n \\nCurrent directory (main module location) \\n \\nEnvironment variable path \\n \\nInstallation dependent directory \\n \\nIf the imported module is not found in any one of the above locations. \\nThen python interpreter gives an error. \\n \\nBuilt-in attributes of a module: \\n \\nBy default for each and every python module some properties are added \\ninternally and we call those properties as a built-in- \\n \\nattribute of a module. (Interview Questions and Answers) \\n \\n17. What is the function of a negative index? \\n \\nAnswer: The sequences in python are indexed and it consists of the \\npositive as well as negative numbers. The numbers that \\nare positive uses ‘0’ that is used as the first index and ‘1’ as the \\nsecond index and the process goes on like that. The index for \\nthe negative number starts from ‘-1’ that represents the last index in \\nthe sequence and ‘-2’ as the penultimate index and the \\nsequence carries forward like the positive number. The negative index is \\nused to remove any new-line spaces from the string \\nand allow the string to except the last character that is given as S[:-\\n1]. The negative index is also used to show the index to \\nrepresent the string in the correct order. \\n \\nWrite a program to check whether the object is of a class or its \\nsubclass. \\n \\nThere is a method which is built-in to show the instances of an object \\nthat consists of many classes by providing a tuple in a \\n\\n\\x0c \\ntable instead of individual classes. The method is given as \\nisinstance(obj,cls) and in more details given as: \\n \\nisinstance(obj, (class1, class2, ...)) that is used to check about the \\nobject\\'s presence in one of the classes. The built in types \\n \\ncan also have many formats of the same function like isinstance(obj, str) \\nor isinstance(obj, (int, long, float, complex)). \\n \\nIt is not preferred to use the class instead of user-defined classes are \\nmade that allow easy object-oriented style to define the \\nbehavior of the object\\'s class. These perform a different thing that is \\nbased on the class. The function differs from one class \\nto another class. \\n \\nTo find out the object of the particular class the following program is \\nused: \\n \\ndef search(obj): \\n \\nif isinstance(obj, box): \\n \\n# This is the code that is given for the box and writes the program in \\nthe object \\nelif isinstance(obj, Document): \\n \\n# This is the code that searches the document and writes the values in it \\n \\nelif \\n \\nobj.search() \\n \\n#This is the function used to search the object\\'s class. \\n \\n18. What is the function of “self”? \\n \\nAnswer: “Self” is a variable that represents the instance of the object \\nto itself. In most of the object-oriented programming \\nlanguage, this is passed as to the methods as a hidden parameter that is \\ndefined by an object. But, in python, it is declared it \\nand pass it explicitly. It is the first argument that gets created in the \\ninstance of class A and the parameters to the methods \\nare passed automatically. It refers to a separate instance of the \\nvariable for individual objects. This is the first argument that \\nis used in the class instance and the “self” method is defined explicitly \\nto all the methods that are used and present. The \\n \\nvariables are referred to as “self.xxx\". \\n \\n19. What are the steps required to make a script executable on Unix? \\n \\nAnswer: The steps that are required to make a script executable are to: \\n \\n— First, create a script file and write the code that has to be executed \\nin it. \\n \\n\\n\\x0c— Make the file mode as executable by making the first line starts with \\n#! this is the line that python interpreter reads. \\n \\n— Set the permission for the file by using chmod +x file. The file uses \\nthe line that is the most important line to be used: \\n#!/usr/local/bin/python \\n \\n- This explains the pathname that is given to the python interpreter and \\nit is independent of the environment programs. \\n— The absolute pathname should be included so that the interpreter can \\ninterpret and execute the code accordingly. The \\nsample code that is written: \\n \\n#1 /bin/sh \\n \\n# Write your code here \\n \\nexec python $0 ${1+’$@\"} \\n \\n# Write the function that needs to be included. \\n \\n20. What are the Packages?? \\n \\nAnswer: The package is nothing but a folder or dictionary which \\nrepresents a collection of modules \\n \\nA package can also contain sub packages \\n \\nWe can import the modules of the package by using the package name. \\nmodule name \\n \\nWe can import the modules of the package by using the package name. \\nsubpackage name.module name \\n \\n21. What is File Handling? \\n \\nAnswer: The file is a named location on the disk, which stores the data \\nin a permanent manner. \\n \\nPython language provides various functions and methods to provide \\ncommunication between python programs and files. \\nPython programs can open the file, perform the read or write operations \\non the file and close the file \\n \\nWe can open the files by calling the open function of built-in-modules \\n \\nAt the time of opening the file, we have to specify the mode of the file \\n \\nMode of the file indicates for what purpose the file is going to be \\nopened(r,w, a,b) \\n \\n22. When would you use a break statement in a for loop? \\nAnswer: The break statement states that the function of the loop is over \\nand to move on to the next block of code. For \\nexample, when the item being searched is found, there is no need to keep \\nlooping. The break statement comes into play here \\n \\n\\n\\x0cand the loop terminates and the execution moves on to the next section of \\nthe code. \\n \\n23. How To Save An Image Locally Using Python Whose URL Address | Already \\nKnow? \\nAnswer: We will use the following code to save an image locally from an \\nURL address \\n \\n1.import urllib.request \\n2.urllib.request.urlretrieve(“URL”, “local-filename.jpg”) \\n \\n24. What is the process to run sub-process with pipes that connect both \\ninput and output? \\n \\nAnswer: The popen2() module is used to run the sub-process but due to \\nsome difficulty in processing like the creation of \\ndeadlock that keeps a process blocked that wait for the output from the \\nchild and child is waiting for the input. The deadlock \\noccurs due to the fact that parent and child don’t have the \\nsynchronization and both are waiting to get the processor to \\nprovide the resources to one another. Use of popen3() method allows the \\nreading of stdout and stderr to take place where \\nthe internal buffer increases and there is no read() takes place to share \\nthe resources. popen2() take care of the deadlock by \\nproviding the methods like wait() and waitpid() that finishes a process \\nfirst and when a request comes it hands over the \\nresponsibility to the process that is waiting for the resources. \\n \\nThe program is used to show the process and run it. \\n \\nimport popen2 \\n \\nfromchild, tochild = popen2.popen2(“command”) \\n \\ntochild.write(“inputn”) \\n \\ntochild.flush() \\n \\noutput = fromchild.readline() \\n \\nTop 54 Python Interview Questions And Answers For Experienced \\n \\n25. What are the different ways to generate random numbers? \\n \\nAnswer: The random module is the standard module that is used to generate \\na random number. \\n \\nThe method is defined as: \\n \\nimport random \\n \\n.random() \\n \\nThe statement random.random() method return the floating point number \\nthat is in the range of [0, 1). The function generates \\nrandom float numbers. The methods that are used with the random class are \\nthe bound methods of the hidden instances. \\n\\n\\x0cThe instances of the Random can be done to show the multi-threading \\nprograms that create a different instance of individual \\nthreads. The other random generators that are used in this are: \\n \\n— randrange(a, b): it chooses an integer and defines the range in-between \\n[a, b). It returns the elements by selecting them \\nrandomly from the range that is specified. It doesn\\'t build a range \\nobject. \\n \\n— uniform(a, b): it chooses a floating point number that is defined in \\nthe range of [a,b).lyt returns the floating point number \\n \\n— normalvariate(mean, sdev): it is used for the normal distribution where \\nthe mu is a mean and the sdev is a sigma that is \\nused for standard deviation. \\n \\n— The Random class that is used and instantiated creates an independent \\nmultiple random number generators. \\n \\nWrite a program to show the singleton pattern used in python. \\n \\nSingleton patter is used to provide a mechanism that limits the number of \\ninstances that can be used by one class. It also \\nallows the same object to be shared between many different parts of the \\ncode. This allows the global variables to be used as \\nthe actual data that is used is hidden by the singleton class interface. \\nThe singleton class interface can have only one public \\nmember and one class method Handle. Private constructors are not used to \\ncreating an object that is used outside the class. \\nThe process waits for the static member function to create new instances \\nand return the singleton object. \\n \\n26. What Are The Built-In Types Available In Python? \\nAnswer: Here is the list of most commonly used built-in types that Python \\nsupports: \\n \\nImmutable built-in types of Python \\n \\nNumbers \\n \\nStrings \\n \\nTuples \\n \\nMutable built-in types of Python \\nList \\n \\nDictionaries \\n \\nSets \\n \\n27. Which methods of Python are used to determine the type of instance \\nand inheritance? \\n \\nAnswer: \\n \\nPython has 2 built-in functions that work with inheritance: \\n \\n\\n\\x0cisinstance() — this method checks the type of instance. \\n \\nfor eg, isinstance(myObj, int) — returns True only when “myObj. class” is \\n“int”. \\nissubclass() — this method checks class inheritance \\n \\nfor eg: issubclass(bool, int) — returns True because “bool” is a subclass \\nof “int”. \\n \\nissubclass(unicode, str) — returns False because “unicode” is not a \\nsubclass of “str”. \\n \\n28. What is the use of enumerate() in Python? \\n \\nAnswer: Using enumerate() function you can iterate through the sequence \\nand retrieve the index position and its \\ncorresponding value at the same time. \\n \\n>>> for iv in enumerate([‘Python’,Java’,C++\\']): \\n \\nprint(i,v) \\n \\n0 Python \\n \\n1 Java \\n \\n2C++ \\n \\n29. How many kinds of sequences are supported by Python? What are they? \\nAnswer: Python supports 7 sequence types. They are str, list, tuple, \\nunicode, bytearray, xrange, and buffer. where xrange is \\ndeprecated in python 3.5.X. \\n \\n30. Name a few methods for matching and searching the occurrences of a \\npattern in a given text String? \\n \\nAnswer: There are 4 different methods in the “re” module to perform \\npattern matching. They are: \\n \\nmatch() — matches the pattern only to the beginning of the String. \\nsearch() - scan the string and look for a location the \\npattern matches findall() — finds all the occurrences of the match and \\nreturn them as a list \\n \\nfinder() — finds all the occurrences of match and return them as an \\niterator. \\n \\n31. Explain how Python does Compile-time and Run-time code checking? \\n \\nAnswer: Python performs some amount of compile-time checking, but most of \\nthe checks such as type, name, etc are \\npostponed until code execution. Consequently, if the Python code \\nreferences a user -a defined function that does not exist, \\nthe code will compile successfully. In fact, the code will fail with an \\nexception only when the code execution path references \\n \\nthe function which does not exist. \\n \\n\\n\\x0c32. What is Abnormal Termination? \\nAnswer: The concept of terminating the program in the middle of its \\nexecution without executing the last statement of the \\n \\nmain module is known as an abnormal termination \\n \\nAbnormal termination is an undesirable situation in programming \\nlanguages. \\n \\n33. What is Try Block? \\nAnswer: A block which is preceded by the try keyword is known as a try \\nblock \\nSyntax: \\n \\ntry{//statements that may cause an exception} \\n \\nThe statements which cause to run time errors and other statements which \\ndepends on the execution of run time errors \\nstatements are recommended to represent in a try block \\n \\nWhile executing try block statement if any exception is raised then \\nimmediately try block identifies that exception, receive that \\n \\nexception and forward that exception to except block without executing \\nremaining statements to try block. \\n \\n34. What is scheduling? \\n \\nAnswer: Among multiple threads which thread as to start the execution \\nfirst, how much time the thread as to execute after \\nallocated time is over, which thread, as to continue the execution next \\nthis, comes under scheduling \\n \\nScheduling is highly dynamic. \\n \\n35. What is Threads Life Cycle? \\n \\nAnswer: Threads Life Cycle \\n \\nCreating the object of a class which is overwriting run method of thread \\nclass is known as a creating thread \\nWhenever a thread is created then we call thread is in new state or birth \\nstate thread. \\n \\nWhenever we call the start method on the new state threads then those \\nthreads will be forwarded for scheduling \\n \\nThe threads which are forwarded for scheduling are known as ready state \\nthreads \\n \\nWhenever scheduling time occurs, ready state thread starts execution \\n \\nThe threads which are executing are known as running state threads \\n \\nWhenever sleep fun or join methods are called on the running state \\nthreads then immediately those threads will wait. \\nThe threads which are waiting are known as waiting for state threads \\n \\n\\n\\x0cWhenever waiting time is over or specified thread execution is over then \\nimmediately waiting state threads are forwarded for \\nscheduling. \\n \\nIf running state threads execution is over then immediately those threads \\nexecution will be terminated \\n \\nThe threads which execution is terminated are known as dead state \\nthreads. \\n \\n36. What is Web Scraping? How do you achieve it in Python? \\n \\nAnswer: Web Scrapping is a way of extracting the large amounts of \\ninformation which is available on the web sites and \\nsaving it onto the local machine or onto the database tables. \\n \\nIn order to scrap the web: load the web page which is interesting to you. \\nTo load the web page, use the “requests” module. \\nparse HTML from the web page to find interesting information. Python has \\nfew modules for scraping the web. They are \\n \\nurllib2, scrapy, pyquery, BeautifulSoap, etc. \\n \\n37. What are Accessors, mutators, @property? \\nAnswer: Accessors and mutators are often called getters and setters in \\nlanguages like “Java”. For example, if x is a property \\nof a user-defined class, then the class would have methods called setX() \\nand getX(). Python has an @property “decorator” \\n \\nthat allows you to ad getters and setters in order to access the \\nattribute of the class. \\n \\n38.

What Are Different Methods To Copy An Object In Python? \\n \\nAnswer: \\n \\nThere are two ways to copy objects in Python. \\n \\ncopy.copy() function \\n \\nIt makes a copy of the file from source to destination. \\n \\nIt\\'ll return a shallow copy of the parameter. \\n \\ncopy.deepcopy() function \\n \\nIt also produces the copy of an object from the source to destination. \\n \\nIt\\'ll return a deep copy of the parameter that you can pass to the \\nfunction. \\n \\n41. When Is The Python Decorator Used? \\n \\nAnswer: Python decorator is a relative change that you do in Python \\nsyntax to adjust the functions quickly. \\n \\n42. What Is The Key Difference Between A List And The Tuple? \\nAnswer: \\n \\nList Vs Tuple. \\nThe major difference between a list and the tuple is that the list is \\nmutable while tuple is not. A tuple is allowed to be hashed, \\nfor example, using it as a key for dictionaries. \\n \\n43. What Is The Purpose Of Doc Strings In Python? \\nAnswer: In Python, a documentation string is popularly known as \\ndocstrings. It sets a process of recording Python functions, \\nmodules, and classes. \\n \\n44. What is Tkinter? \\n \\nAnswer: Tkinter is a Python library. It is a toolkit for GUI development. \\nIt provides support for various GUI tools or widgets \\n(such as buttons, labels, text boxes, radio buttons, etc) that are used \\nin GUI applications.

Name and explain the three magic methods of Python that are used in \\nthe construction and initialization of custom \\nObjects? \\n \\nAnswer: The 3 magic methods of Python that are used in the construction \\nand initialization of custom Objects are: init_, new, \\nand del_. \\n\\n\\x0c \\nnew - this method can be considered as a “constructor”. It is invoked to \\ncreate an instance of a class with the statement \\nsaid, myObj = MyClass() \\n \\ninit_ — It is an “initializer\"/ “constructor” method. It is invoked \\nwhenever any arguments are passed at the time of creating an \\nobject. myObj = MyClass(‘Pizza’,25) \\ndel- this method is a “destructor” of the class. Whenever an object is \\ndeleted, \\n \\nthe invocation of del__ takes place and it defines behavior during the \\ngarbage collection. \\n \\nNote: new, del are rarely used explicitly. \\n \\n46. Which Python Function Will You Use To Convert A Number To A String? \\nAnswer: For converting a number into a string, you can use the built-in \\nfunction <str()>. If you want an octal or hexadecimal \\nrepresentation, use the inbuilt function <oct()> or <hex()>. \\n \\n47. How Do You Debug A Program In Python? Is It Possible To Step Through \\nPython Code? \\nAnswer: Yes, we can use the Python debugger () to debug any Python \\nprogram. And if we start a program using, then it let us \\neven step through the code. \\n \\n48. List Down Some Of The PDB Commands For Debugging Python Programs? \\nAnswer: Here are a few PDB commands to start debugging Python code. \\n \\ne Add breakpoint \\n \\ne Resume execution \\n \\ne Step by step debugging \\n© Move to next line \\n \\n* List source code \\n \\ne Print an expression \\n \\n49. Why And When Do You Use Generators In Python? \\nAnswer: A generator in Python is a function which returns an iterable \\nobject. We can iterate on the generator object using the \\nkeyword. But we can only do that once because their values don\\'t persist \\nin memory, they get the values on the fly. \\n \\nGenerators give us the ability to hold the execution of a function or a \\nstep as long as we want to keep it. However, here are a \\nfew examples where it is beneficial to use generators. \\n \\nWe can replace loops with generators for efficiently calculating results \\ninvolving large data sets. \\nGenerators are useful when we don’t want all the results and wish to hold \\nback for some time. \\nInstead of using a callback function, we can replace it with a generator. \\nWe can write a loop inside the function doing the \\n \\n\\n\\x0csame thing as the callback and turns it into a generator. \\n \\n50. Explain split(), sub(), sub() methods of “re” module in Python? \\nAnswer: To modify the strings, Python\\'s “re” module is providing 3 \\nmethods. They are: \\n \\nsplit) - uses a regex pattern to “split” a given string into a list. \\nsub() — finds all substrings where the regex pattern matches and then \\nreplace them with a different string \\nsubn() - it is similar to sub() and also returns the new string along \\nwith the no. of replacements \\n \\n51. How can you generate random numbers in Python? \\nAnswer: The random module is the standard module that is used to generate \\na random number. The method is defined as: \\n \\n1.import random \\n2.random.random \\n \\nThe statement random.random() method return the floating point number \\nthat is in the range of [0, 1). The function generates \\n \\nrandom float numbers. The methods that are used with the random class are \\nthe bound methods of the hidden instances. \\nThe instances of the Random can be done to show the multi-threading \\nprograms that create a different instance of individual \\nthreads. The other random generators that are used in this are: \\n \\nrandrange(a, b): it chooses an integer and defines the range in-between \\n[a, b). It returns the elements by selecting them \\nrandomly from the range that is specified. It doesn’t build a range \\nobject. \\n \\nuniform(a, b): it chooses a floating point number that is defined in the \\nrange of [a,b).lyt returns the floating point number \\nnormalvariate(mean, sdev): it is used for the normal distribution where \\nthe mu is a mean and the sdev is a sigma that is used \\nfor standard deviation. \\n \\nThe Random class that is used and instantiated creates an independent \\nmultiple random number generators. \\n \\n52. What advantages do NumPy arrays offer over (nested) Python lists? \\n \\nAnswer: Python\\'s lists are efficient general-purpose containers. They \\nsupport (fairly) efficient insertion, deletion, appending, \\nand concatenation, and Python’s list comprehensions make them easy to \\nconstruct and manipulate. \\n \\nThey have certain limitations: they don’t support “vectorized” operations \\nlike elementwise addition and multiplication, and the \\nfact that they can contain objects of differing types mean that Python \\nmust store type information for every element, and \\nmust execute type dispatching code when operating on each element. \\n \\nNumPy is not just more efficient; it is also more convenient. You get a \\nlot of vector and matrix operations for free, which \\n\\n\\x0csometimes allow one to avoid unnecessary work. And they are also \\nefficiently implemented. \\n \\nNumPy array is faster and you get a lot built-in with NumPy, FFTs, \\nconvolutions, fast searching, basic statistics, linear algebra, \\nhistograms, etc. \\n \\n53. What does this mean: *args, **kwargs? And why would we use it? \\n \\nAnswer: We use *args when we aren\\'t sure how many arguments are going to \\nbe passed to a function, or if we want to pass a \\nstored list or tuple of arguments to a function. **kwargsis used when we \\ndon’t know how many keyword arguments will be \\npassed to a function, or it can be used to pass the values of a \\ndictionary as keyword arguments. The identifiers args and \\n \\nkwargs are a convention, you could also use *bob and *billy but that \\nwould not be wise. \\n \\n54. How Does Python Handle The Memory Management? \\n \\nAnswer: Python uses private heaps to maintain its memory. So the heap \\nholds all the Python objects and the data structures. \\nThis area is only accessible to the Python interpreter; programmers can\\'t \\nuse it. \\n \\nAnd it\\'s the Python memory manager that handles the Private heap. It does \\nthe required allocation of the heap for Python \\nobjects. \\n \\nPython employs a built-in garbage collector, which salvages all the \\nunused memory and offloads it to the heap space. \\n \\n \\n\\n\\x0c'"

       " \" A generator in Python is a function which returns an iterable \\nobject. We can iterate on the generator object using the \\nkeyword. But we can only do that once because their values don't persist \\nin memory, they get the values on the fly. \\n \\nGenerators give us the ability to hold the execution of a function or a \\nstep as long as we want to keep it. However, here are a \\nfew examples where it is beneficial to use generators. \\n \\nWe can replace loops with generators for efficiently calculating results \\ninvolving large data sets. \\nGenerators are useful when we don’t want all the results and wish to hold \\nback for some time. \\nInstead of using a callback function, we can replace it with a generator. \\nWe can write a loop inside the function doing the \\n \\n\\n\\x0csame thing as the callback and turns it into a generator. \\n \\n50.
